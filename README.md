Everyone is welcome to visit my code repository.
This is a self-written lottery program.,Due to the limited ability of developers.,I can't write the UI interface yet.,You can only make do with it in the command line.
The program uses time as the seed of the rand function to generate random numbers to achieve the ability to draw lots, the program stores the number of the person drawn each time in data.log a log file, and each time the program starts, it will read the log file, store the number in the hash table and compare it when generating a random number, so as to ensure that the same person will not be drawn again and again in each draw.
Have a good time~~~~~
